ARCHIVE :

Once you have decompressed the archive, you will be provided 
with a directory named PosSmodels1.1 and containing

. COPYING : a file containing the  GNU general public license

. Examples : a directory containing some examples of possibilistic normal logic programs

. README : this file

. SRC : a directory containing all source files for preprocLparse and posSmodels

. computePosStableModels : a shell script to run the whole system by
               computePosStableModels f k
  if you want to compute k possibilistic stable models of the program in file f



INSTALLATION (tested only on Linux System)

. You need to have all the .o and .h files  of Smodels 2.28 in a
  directory smodels-2.28 placed at the same level of PosSmodels directory.
  (Smodels is available at http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/)

. The directory structure has to be like :

|---smodels-2.28
|
|---PosSmodels1.1
|    |
|    |--COPYING
|    |--Examples
|    |   |--...
|    |   
|    |--README
|    |--SRC
|    |   |--...
|    |   
|    |--computePosStableModels

. Go to PosSmodels1.1/SRC directory and run make all

. Then, from PosSmodels1.1 directory, you can use our system by launching
       preprocLparse f | lparse --true-negation | posSmodels k
  or
       computePosStableModels f k
  if you want to compute k possibilistic stable models of the program in file f

NOTE : You must have an executable version of Lparse
   (Lparse is available at http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/)
